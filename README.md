# Friction surfaces and least cost path analysis in R

Data preparation and GIS analysis in R as an alternative to ArcGIS PRO functions which involves:

- generating a friction surface by rasterizing given vector data
- performing cost distance analysis to calculate emergency response time raster for Tartu region, Estonia
- write the resulting raster as a tiff file
